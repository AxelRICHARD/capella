#* A search can look only into Capella projects with opening session.
#* A search can be performed in two modes: '''containing a text''' or '''matching a regular expression''' (with content assist for finding a right regular expression)
#* A search can be performed only if the validation is passed:
#** At least one project selected
#** At least one search field selected
#** Search pattern is not empty and is a valid regular expression if the search mode is matching a regular expression.
# Results of search are shown in the '''Search''' view
